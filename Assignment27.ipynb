There are four main levels:\n\n1. Nominal Level: Data is categorized into distinct groups or categories without any specific order or ranking. Example: Gender (Male, Female).\n2. Ordinal Level: Data is categorized into ordered groups, but the intervals between the categories are not meaningful. Example: Education level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).\n3. Interval Level: Data is ordered with meaningful intervals between values, but there is no true zero point. Example: Temperature in Celsius (20°C, 25°C, 30°C).\n4. Ratio Level: Data has a true zero point, and both differences and ratios are meaningful. Example: Weight (50 kg, 75 kg, 100 kg).",

This tells you about the specific class, not about any larger group.\nUse: To summarize data, e.g., calculating averages or percentages.\n\nInferential Statistics: Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. It uses probability and hypothesis testing to draw conclusions.\nExample: Surveying 100 people to predict the voting outcome for a larger population.
